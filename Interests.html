        <div class="pBox1">
          <p>When I was about 17 years old, a goal I accomplished involved building
            and programming my first computer completely from researching parts.
            I was already heavily invested in learning about technology from a
            young start, but when I was 17, I had my first job and saved the money
            to buy all the pieces. I would say that I have been in love with technology since.</p>

      <h3 id="lifeChange">Life changes and if you look away to long you'll miss it</h3>
      <div class="boxParagraph">
        <div class="pBox">
          <p>The most significant motivation to accomplish my goals comes from the
            deep-ridden negativity that has hindered my success in the past.
            I spent a lot of my life listening to the people that shot down every idea
            that I had and any idea of what I wanted to do in life. It took a long time
            to realize they either thought what I wanted was out of my reach or they
            couldn't do it themselves, so someone else shouldn't either. Regardless
            of their intentions, it put me in a pretty dark place for quite a while,
            and I got caught up in the wheel. I went around and around with those thoughts,
            and they didn't get me anywhere closer to where I wanted to be or what I aspire to accomplish.
            I think it only confused me on what I am capable of doing.
            Once I started listening to myself and figuring out where
            I wanted to go gave me the insight to see my mistakes,
            not to fault them but to learn from them.
          </p>
          <p>So.... Why not just learn anything I can about everything that interests me?
            That's my plan.</p>

              One thing I have always enjoyed has been working with images.
              Coming from drawing doodles in art class to my first photoshop class
              in the 7th grade, getting handed a DSLR at age 10 to play with,
              I have always loved pictures. Editing pictures and videos have offhand
              been a hobby of mine as far back as I can remember. The picture is an
              excellent piece my Photoshop instructor at Chandler-Gilbert Community
              College drew and had us paint using digital brushes. I used some new
              skills to change a few things. <a id="instagramLink" href="https://www.instagram.com/garzaarte/">@garzaarte</a>

            <figcaption>When I think of freedom, I think of an open road and a full tank of gas
              because if there isn't anything else that I would love to do more is more
              than getting out on the highways in the southwest and going. This is a picture of my
              Harley Davidson Street Bob.</figcaption>

            <figcaption>
              I am interested in the stock market and cryptocurrencies so
              I created a trading card to give NFTs a try on the Etherium blockchain with the sudden
              surge of online and real-world uncertainty.
              The craze of trading stocks,
              and holding crypto with the allusive
              golden ticket ever on the horizon.
              I'm sure most would like to find themselves on the moon.

            <figcaption>I love this blue little guy! I can't bring up much else to say other than
              there is just something spectacular about timepieces, I don't know what it is,
              but I tend to enjoy looking at, searching for, and wearing all sorts of watches.

          <dt>What do I want to be?</dt>
          <div class="ddBox">
            <dd>I want to be an AI engineer because I think it would be cool
              to invent something valuable to reinvent how we communicate with technology. </dd>

          <dt>Less Stress</dt>
          <div class="ddBox">
            <dd>I enjoy deciding when to complete specific actions and when
              certain projects would work out based on deadlines further out rather
              than more closely monitored projects. </dd>
          </div>
          <dt>Preferred Work</dt>
          <div class="ddBox">
            <dd>I prefer a job that I primarily work work independently,
              but I would like to be in a situation where I regularly work with clients.
              Either in media production, filming, photography, or coding. </dd>
          </div>
          <dt>Dreaming Forward</dt>
          <div class="ddBox">
            <dd>I want to create valuable and meaningful things either for
              people to use daily or consume daily. This work is either through
              creating multi-media or through the work I do programming.
              I want to give back in a way that doesn't involve closing minds
              but rather opening them to something different or enjoyable. </dd>
          </div>
          <dt>Less Mundane</dt>
          <div class="ddBox">
            <dd>I prefer a little consistency in my work, but the content
              of every day could be entirely different. I feel that I enjoy
              having the option to alternate on what I need to accomplish,
              but the things I do need to perform are ever-changing is critical
              to keep my interests moving forward. I, too often, get caught in the
              mundane of repetition and lose interest, so involving myself in familiar
              motions with ever-changing content I believe is critical to my success. </dd>
          </div>
          <dt>Future Thoughts</dt>
          <div class="ddBox">
            <dd>Ten years into the future, I am looking to take the time to work
              when it suits my life schedule. That could mean I work a few months
              out of the year and take a few months off work depending on contract
              work and self-funded or investor-funded ventures. I am not looking to
              have the work; I do feel like it is work. </dd>
