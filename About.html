      <h2> Greetings, it is a delight to have you visit my website.</h2>
      <div class="introBox">
        <p>My name is Justin,
          and I am a 29 - year old cancer survivor. A week before my 25th birthday,
          I received the diagnosis of end-stage testicular cancer.
          After a long road of treatment and surgeries,
          I was declared cancer-free in November of 2016 and,
          to this day, still going strong.</p>

      <div class="introTwoBox">
        <p>I am interested in so much and continuously find new things to stretch my mind.
          Whether this is working on my car, fixing friends' cars or motorcycles,
          building computers, repairing computers, live streaming video games,
          or even devising a new home-brewed creation.
          Now that I am on the road to better health and back to feeling more like myself,
          I have decided to pursue a career as a technology wizard
          (Currently in school seeking a degree in programming).
          The way I see going back to school is that it is never
          too late for me or anyone to get a start on something that is going to
          change the way life flows. Including building websites to stretch my
          technology skills.
